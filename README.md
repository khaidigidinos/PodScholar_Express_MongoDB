# PodScholar_Express_MongoDB

This project is using:
- JWT for authentication
- MongoDB Atlas for using database
- ExpressJS for server-side
- EJS template for rendering HTML, CSS and JS files.

To make some simplicities to this project, there are some notable things:
- An author can only save a podcast once and cannot unsave it.
- An author can only like a podcast once and cannot dislike it.
- An author can only follow another author once and cannot unfollow him/her.
- DELETE api for a podcast is implemented; however, there are not any places call it.
- GET comments for a podcast is implemented; however, there are not any places call it.
- Some specifications are unclear that the front-end will note them with a text.
- Forgot password is not supported, although it appears on the front-end.
